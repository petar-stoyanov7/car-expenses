# Car Expenses #
## Disclaimer
This is my course project for a PHP course I took in 2016. It's pending a large rework, and can be considered abandoned 
at its current state.

### Purpose ###
This is a free open source web application, intended to let you track the expenses you made with your car, and then 
extract various statistics, such as cost per kilometer, overall money spent etc. This is still a work in progress, 
I have more features in mind and given the time - will implement them

### Usage ### 
This application is free to use. Redistribution is prohibited, just as using it for commercial purposes.

### Installation ###
Before running locally - you need to compile the .scss files contained in `Application/Views/scss` to `public/css/`. 
You can use the Node library **sass** `npm -i -g sass` using `sass {path}/Application/Views/scss:{path}/public/css`. 
Yes, it's stupid, as mentioned above - this needs to go a complete overhaul.
